<p id= "para1" style="color:red;">Anushka made her acting debut in Puri Jagannadh's 2005 Telugu film Super, where she featured alongside Akkineni Nagarjuna and Ayesha Takia. IndiaGlitz said "The two girls, Ayesha and Anushka, are cool and chic. Their angles and curves provide all the glamour and keep you engrossed. What about their acting? Well, they are in this film for it."[16] and Sify stated, "The sexy girls Ayesha and Anushka show off their bodies."[17] The same year, she acted in another film Maha Nandi, opposite Srihari and Sumanth. IndiaGlitz said, "Anushka looks comely ---and that is what she seems to be in for." but added, "The script has been stitched and the seams look frayed."[18] Sify stated that it "starts promisingly with a racy first half but goes awry and the tempo slackens post interval." and added, "Anushka looks ravishing thanks to Vasu’s camera which is a major plus for the film."[19]

<p id ="para2" style="color:blue;">In 2006, she had four releases, the first being S. S. Rajamouli's Vikramarkudu, where she was paired with Ravi Teja. The film went on to become very successful and got her much recognition, making her very popular in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.[20][21] Kishore of Nowrunning.com said "The high points of the movie are the flawless acting of Raviteja and the lusciousness of Anushka. Raviteja has got all the ingredients that an actor should have and Anushka has all the assets to that a woman ought to have."[22] and Sify said that Anushka "is definitely a highlight."[23]
